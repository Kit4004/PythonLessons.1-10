#For

#get a list

#Range

# The built-in range function in Python is very useful to generate sequences
# of numbers in the form of a list. 

# while loop. keeps looping until false

'''The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence
in order, executing the block each time. Contrast the for statement
with the ''while'' loop, used when a condition needs to be checked
each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever'''
